# VisualGPT beta 1.0 -- A simple python script that interacts with GPT-3.5 turbo to print answers in the terminal once you run the script 
# It can now check if the prompt provided is valid along with the API key and if not returns with an error/warning message 
# Please make sure to install the python interpreter and OpenAI python package before running this script, otherwise it will NOT work (pip install openai - run in terminal) -- Works with Python applications only.
# Install Python from microsoft store (if you're on windows) or the python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
